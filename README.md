# Trivia
<p>Welcome to Trivia, my CS50W final project.</p>
<p>Trivia is a web application that pulls data from public APIs, parses the responses and formats them into questions.<br>
<p>Trivia uses a combination of a Python backend running Django and a Javascript frontend to create a responsive, reactive website. </p>
